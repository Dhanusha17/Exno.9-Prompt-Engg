## NAME: DHANUSHA K
## REG NO: 212223040034

## **Aim:**  
To explore various prompting techniques used for **AI-based video generation** and understand how prompt refinement impacts the visual quality and realism of generated videos.  
The selected theme for this experiment is **“The Water Cycle”**, showcasing how different levels of prompt detail influence the output.

## **Algorithm:**  
Explore how prompting techniques can generate and manipulate educational video content (e.g., animations, transitions, and camera movement) using AI models like Gemini or Runway Gen-2.


## **Procedure:**

### **Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with IMAGE Generation Tools**
Before generating the videos, study AI tools such as:  
- **Gemini** – for text-to-video generation.  
- **Runway Gen-2** – for realistic video motion.  
- **Pictory** – for text-to-educational narration videos.  

Each tool supports creating short clips from text-based prompts and i used the GEMINI VEO 3


### **Step 2: Create the Prompts**

In this experiment, three levels of prompts were used for the **Water Cycle video generation**:



### **Prompt 1 – Basic Prompt**
"A simple animation showing the process of the water cycle, including evaporation, condensation, and rainfall."

**Output:**

### **Prompt 2 – Refined Prompt**
"A detailed educational animation of the water cycle showing the sun heating a lake, evaporation forming clouds, condensation in the sky, and rainfall completing the cycle with smooth transitions."

**Output:**  
<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18c3ff87-3ba7-4730-86b5-5c28664fabc4" />



### **Prompt 3 – Advanced Prompt**
"A cinematic 3D animation of the complete water cycle with camera movement following the vapor rising into clouds, zooming out to show rainfall and collection in lakes, using realistic colors and natural sound effects."

**Output:**

### **Step 3: Observation**

| Prompt Level | Description | Visual Quality | Scene Details | Motion/Camera Effects |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Basic | Simple description | Moderate | Limited elements | None |
| Refined | Added sunlight and transitions | Good | Clearer visuals | Basic transitions |
| Advanced | Cinematic style with motion | Excellent | Realistic scenes | Smooth camera effects |


### **Step 4: Evaluation**

- The **basic prompt** produced a simple and clear animation.  
- The **refined prompt** improved visual richness and scene transitions.  
- The **advanced prompt** delivered professional, cinematic motion with dynamic camera movement.  
- Adding details about **lighting, transitions, and motion** significantly improved AI understanding of the visual output.


## **Result:**  
The prompts were successfully executed to generate three AI-based educational videos on **“The Water Cycle.”**  
As the prompt detail increased, the quality, clarity, and motion of the generated videos improved.  
This demonstrates that **structured and descriptive prompting** leads to more engaging and realistic video outputs.
